Ruby gem serving as the reference implementation for the parsing and consumption of [Digicus Textual Representation (DTR)](https://spaced-out-thoughts-dev-foundation.github.io/digicus/#digicus-textual-representation).We expect folks to leverage this gem when writing Digicus [compiler plugins](https://spaced-out-thoughts-dev-foundation.github.io/digicus/#a-compiler-plugin-framework). As an example of this, consider looking at:

* [Soroban Rust Backend](https://github.com/spaced-out-thoughts-dev-foundation/soroban_rust_backend)
* [Digicus Web Backend](https://github.com/spaced-out-thoughts-dev-foundation/digicus_web_backend)
